# EUSEDcollab
The code associated with the EUSEDcollab sediment yield data repository: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22117559

The repository contains the following code:

1) A Jupyter notebook containing the code to perform some simple analyses of the EUSEDcollab data repository. This also contains descriptive information of each step to guide users less familiar with the processing steps. The code should be run in a local environment containing the neccessary python libraries. 

2) A jupyter notebook showing a simple example using Google Earth Engine through the Python API to extract values at the EUSEDcollab monitoring station points. 

3) The R code to perform the quality control procedure on the each catchment time series.
